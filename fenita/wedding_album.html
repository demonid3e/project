            Digital Matt Album is another great album we are offering our brides
            and grooms. This album comes only in one size 10'x14', but it comes
            with very beautiful white box, what makes this album look more
            mysterious and of course give it extra protection. The pictures are
            printed directly on colored matt boards,we can add different frames
            and textures to every picture, they can be matt or raised varnished,
            what gives them a 3D effect. The pictures have a special coating,
            which protects them from fading. First time in digital printing era,
            you will be able to add translucent pages between the pictures, and
            your album will get old classic view. Your own title and one of
            various covers we offer will personalize your memories and make them
            even more special.

            Digital Young Book is one more great alternative to our Wedding
            Book. When I first saw this album, I was impressed with its
            simplicity, minimalism, but it still looks very elegant and modern.
            The albums comes with the same style rigid box, and you can choose
            same or different material and colors for album and box. The cover
            of the Young Book is thinner and simpler, but "Simple is the best"
            is the best description for this album. We are offering Our Young
            book comes in three different size: 8'x10', 10'x14' and 14'x18' with
            minimum 30 pages. The pictures are directly printed on the pages,
            like in all our wedding albums.
